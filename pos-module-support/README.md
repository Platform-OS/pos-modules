# Support Desk module

A white-label support desk for platformOS apps. Customers email you; every email becomes or joins a ticket; your team works the queue at `/support-desk` and replies from the ticket. The desk takes the host app's colours, fonts, name and logo, installs as its own app (PWA) with push notifications, and works on any app: one with members and an admin area, or a marketing site with no users at all.

> **Status: in development** on the `feature/pos-module-support` branch. Not yet released to the marketplace.

## What it does (MVP)

- Email to ticket through the email provider you choose at install (SendGrid in the first release), with threading by reply token, headers and subject.
- Agent queue as a list (swim lanes) or a board (columns), grouped by priority or status; the layout and grouping stay as agents switch views; departments with live counts in the side navigation. Ticket page with replies and internal notes, saved replies, collision warnings and live updates.
- Departments, statuses over six fixed categories, priorities P0–P3 with SLA targets and business hours.
- Least-loaded auto-assignment with an escalation safety net.
- Push and email alerts for agents, each switchable per person.
- Team managed inside the module: pick existing staff or invite people by email; invited outsiders get Support only.
- Blocklist and Mark as spam, webhook secret rotation, audit log.

## Requirements

- Modules: `core`, `user`, `common-styling`, `push_notifications` (installed with this module).
- An email provider account. The MVP ships the SendGrid adapter: an API key with Mail Send, Sender Authentication, Inbound Parse and Event Webhook (Mail Settings) access, and a hostname for inbound mail whose MX record you can set.
- On staging instances, enable **API call notifications** for the instance in the Partner Portal, or outgoing API calls (SendGrid) are not sent.

## Installation

1. Install the module and deploy the app once, so the module's tables, pages and seed migration (statuses, a default department "Support", SLA policy, settings, ticket counter) are on the instance:

   ```bash
   pos-cli modules install support
   pos-cli deploy <env>
   ```

2. Run the install generator and answer its questions:

   ```bash
   pos-cli generate run modules/support/generators/install
   ```

   Every step checks what exists first, so you can run it again at any time (for another environment, or after fixing something); a second run changes nothing. It never edits the host's permissions file and never writes a password or secret to a file. It:

   - keeps or removes the Support entry in host admin menus (`admin/support`);
   - names the **first support admin**: an existing user gets an admin membership; a new user is created with no host roles and the password you type, sent straight to the environment; the email is also stored in `modules/support/ADMIN_EMAILS` for recovery;
   - reports whether anonymous visitors can register (`users.register` on `anonymous`) — marketing sites usually turn that off;
   - optionally gives host roles that can see the admin area (`admin_pages.view`) a support role (`role_map` setting);
   - creates `app/lib/hooks/hook_headscripts.liquid` (your layout's stylesheets, so the desk uses your theme) and `app/lib/hooks/hook_support_branding.liquid` (name, logo, colours) if they do not exist;
   - sets the email provider, its API key (`EMAIL_API_KEY`) and the inbound hostname, and generates `INBOUND_SECRET`, `EVENTS_SECRET` and `REPLY_TOKEN_SECRET`;
   - tells you to run the push module's generator if the push keys are missing;
   - prints the DNS record and the (masked) inbound webhook URL.

3. Deploy again (`pos-cli deploy <env>`) if the generator wrote hook files, sign in at `/support-desk/sign-in` as the first admin, and finish **Settings → Email** (next section).

4. Add your team in **Settings → Team** (pick existing users or invite by email), departments in **Settings → Departments**, and adjust **SLA and hours** (business hours default to Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00).

## Email setup (SendGrid)

Settings → Email walks through these steps; each unlocks the next and its result is stored in the `email_status` setting:

1. **API key** — paste or rotate the key; "Check" calls SendGrid with it.
2. **Sending domain** — authenticate the domain you send from in SendGrid (Sender Authentication); the page shows the DNS records SendGrid gives you and checks them.
3. **Inbound** — add the MX record `10 mx.sendgrid.net` for your inbound hostname; "Create" registers the Inbound Parse host with the webhook URL `https://<your-app>/api/support/inbound/sendgrid/<INBOUND_SECRET>` (raw MIME on). The URL is masked; Reveal shows it.
4. **Test** — sends a test email; "Check inbound" waits for one to arrive.
5. **Delivery events** — creates the module's own Event Webhook (`/api/support/email-events/sendgrid/<EVENTS_SECRET>`) so bounces show on the ticket. An account's other Event Webhooks are left alone.
6. **Enable** — turns on sending. Until then nothing is emailed to customers.

"Rotate secret" generates a new inbound secret, updates SendGrid and accepts the previous secret for 24 hours, so no mail is lost. Choose the EU API region on the same page if your SendGrid account is in the EU.

Outgoing mail: every customer email gets its own `Message-ID` (stored before sending) and a signed reply address (`<department>+t.<number>.<mac>@<inbound host>`) in `Reply-To`. Attachments are capped at 10 MB per email.

## Access

The desk is a standalone section at `/support-desk` with its own sign-in at `/support-desk/sign-in`. Access comes only from the module's team membership records (`team_member`), never from the host's roles or permissions file:

- A host user with the `superadmin` role gets an admin membership on their first visit.
- An email listed in `modules/support/ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated) gets an admin membership on first visit; use it to recover access.
- Holders of a host role listed in the `role_map` setting get that support role on first visit (off by default).
- Invited people accept at `/support-desk/invites/:id`; anyone else signed in sees "You don't have access to Support" and can request access, which support admins approve in Settings → Team.
- A disabled membership is never recreated.

Sign-in lock: 5 failed desk sign-ins for an email within 15 minutes lock it for the rest of that window. The module implements pos-module-user's `user_login` hook, so a sign-in through any other password form of the instance (such as the host's `/sessions`) while the lock is on is marked, and the desk signs that session out on its next desk page. Failed attempts on those other forms (and 2FA codes on `/sessions/2fa`) are not counted by the desk: rate-limit the host's own sign-in form, or remove it if desk users only sign in at `/support-desk/sign-in`.

Support roles: `agent` (own departments, reply), `manager` (all departments, reassign, merge, reports), `admin` (also Team and Settings). The optional page `admin/support` (permission `admin_pages.view`, `metadata.menu.title: Support`) adds Support to host admin menus built from page metadata and only redirects to `/support-desk`.

## Constants

| Constant | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `modules/support/ADMIN_EMAILS` | comma-separated emails that get an admin membership on first visit (recovery) |
| `modules/support/EMAIL_API_KEY` | the email provider's API key |
| `modules/support/INBOUND_SECRET` | secret path segment of the inbound webhook URL |
| `modules/support/EVENTS_SECRET` | secret path segment of the delivery-events webhook URL |
| `modules/support/REPLY_TOKEN_SECRET` | signs the reply token in `Reply-To` addresses; set once at install, never change it on a live desk (old replies would stop threading) |

The generator sets all of them; `pos-cli constants set <env> --name modules/support/<NAME> --value <value>` changes one by hand.

## Settings

Stored in the module's `setting` table and edited under `/support-desk/settings/*` (support admins only): departments (name, short code, inbound local part, From address, signature, SLA policy), statuses (labels over the fixed categories `new`, `open`, `pending`, `on_hold`, `solved`, `closed`; confirmation mode `auto_close`/`keep_open` and 1–28 days), SLA policies and business hours (time zone, days, holidays), saved replies (variables `{{ requester.first_name }}`, `{{ requester.name }}`, `{{ ticket.number }}`, `{{ ticket.subject }}`, `{{ agent.first_name }}`, `{{ brand.name }}`), assignment (unassigned alert minutes, P0 alert, escalate after, spam threshold), team, blocklist, email, branding and integrations (maintenance sweep status and restart). Keys used in code: `email_provider`, `email_region`, `inbound_domain`, `email_status`, `role_map`, `staff_roles`, `free_mail_domains`, `confirmation_mode`, `confirmation_wait_days`, `unassigned_alert_minutes`, `unassigned_alert_minutes_p0`, `escalate_after_minutes`, `spam_threshold`, `branding_override`, `business_hours`, `sweep_heartbeat`, `email_redirect_to`, `email_allow_external`, `sweep_started_at`, `ticket_stats_counted_at` (time of the last full count of the stored ticket counts).

### Non-production sending

The desk calls the email provider's API itself, so the platformOS instance
`test_email` address never rewrites its recipients. Off production
(`context.environment != 'production'`) the recipient guard decides what may
leave, and Settings -> Email shows the choice:

| | |
|---|---|
| `email_redirect_to` set | every recipient is replaced by that address; the real ones go in the subject and an `X-Support-Original-To` header |
| `email_allow_external: true` | send to the real recipients |
| neither | the send is refused with `non_production_recipient_blocked` (the default) |

Two kinds of message always go out, because neither can reach a customer and
Enable needs both setup steps to pass: the setup's own test email, which is
addressed to the admin who pressed the button, and a message whose every
recipient is on the desk's own `inbound_domain`, which is the inbound check.

A test or suite that asserts on the address the desk chose must set
`email_allow_external: true` and clear `email_redirect_to` (see
`tests/e2e/liquid/setup.liquid`).

## Hooks

| Hook | Return | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `support_branding` | object: `app_name`, `short_name`, `logo_url`, `logo_dark_url`, `icon_url`, `favicon_url`, `theme_color`, `background_color`, `theme_mode` (`auto`/`light`/`dark`), `rail_theme` (`auto`/`light`/`dark`: pins which logo the sidebar shows; `auto` by default, which picks it from the sidebar's actual colour), `support_email_name` | brand in the desk, emails, manifest and push. Every key is optional; without `app_name` the desk is named after the instance domain (the first label of a `*.platform-os.com` host, e.g. `support-development` → "Support Development", or the custom domain without `www.`). `icon_url` (a square 512 px PNG) replaces the module's icons in the PWA manifest and the iOS home-screen icon. Without any icon, the first desk admin who opens the desk has their browser draw the sidebar monogram (first letter, brand colours, desk font) as a 512 px PNG and store it (`branding_monogram` setting); it becomes the app icon, favicon and push icon, and is redrawn when the name's first letter or the brand colours change |
| `support_assignment` (alter) | sets `params_to_modify.assignee_id` and `.reason` from `params.ticket`, and must `return params_to_modify` | host rule that decides who gets a new ticket before least-loaded assignment |
| `headscripts` (core) | HTML string | host stylesheet, loaded after the module CSS so host tokens win |

The module implements `user_login` (pos-module-user) to mark a sign-in on another form while the desk sign-in lock is on for that email; the desk signs such a session out.

The desk has its own compact type scale, control sizes and layout, built from the host's common-styling tokens: the brand colour (`--pos-color-button-primary-*`) drives primary buttons, focus, selection and the monogram; the rail is a quiet neutral by default. Headings use the body font (`--pos-support-font-heading`), not common-styling's monospace heading font. The desk loads only the common-styling stylesheets it uses (no Markdown editor, highlight.js or Uppy) and sets softer dark neutrals than pure black; a host stylesheet that sets `--pos-color-dark-*` still wins.

CSS tokens a host can override: `--pos-support-font`, `--pos-support-font-heading`, `--pos-support-rail-width`, `--pos-support-rail-background`, `--pos-support-rail-text`, `--pos-support-rail-active-background`, `--pos-support-rail-active-text`, `--pos-support-rail-hover-background`, `--pos-support-rail-frame`, `--pos-support-monogram-background`, `--pos-support-monogram-text` (also the default emblem's colours), `--pos-support-tint-{1,2,3}` and `--pos-support-tint-border` (brand tints), `--pos-support-scrollbar`, `--pos-support-accent-ink`, `--pos-support-radius-{control,card,panel}`, `--pos-support-control-height`, plus every common-styling `--pos-*` token. The desk derives light tints of the host's primary colour (`--pos-color-button-primary-background`) for the sidebar, board columns and their headers, selected toggles and scrollbars: opaque oklch mixes into the page background, at most 18% brand, so text keeps 4.5:1 with any brand colour, light or dark. `--pos-support-accent-ink` is the brand colour clamped in lightness, used where the brand colour is a border or icon on the page. For a brand-coloured rail set `--pos-support-rail-background` to the brand colour and `--pos-support-rail-text` to white, and give `support_branding` a `logo_dark_url` that reads on it. When the host gives both logos, the desk measures the sidebar's background in the browser and shows the logo made for it, so a dark brand-coloured sidebar gets the dark-background logo in both colour schemes; nothing else to set. `rail_theme` pins the choice if needed. Without JavaScript the logo follows `theme_mode` and then the device setting.

Status, priority, SLA, internal-note, avatar and presence colours are fixed semantic tokens with light and dark values checked for 4.5:1 contrast: `--pos-support-status-{new,open,pending,onhold-eng,onhold,solved,closed}-{fg,bg}`, `--pos-support-priority-p{0..3}-{fg,bg}`, `--pos-support-sla-{overdue,soon,ok,paused}`, `--pos-support-note-{bg,border,fg}`, `--pos-support-avatar-{0..7}` (+ `-fg`), `--pos-support-presence-{available,away,off}`, `--pos-support-avatar-customer` (+ `-fg`), and the department markers `--pos-support-dept-{neutral,indigo,violet,taupe,olive,fuchsia,cobalt,ocean,copper,plum,rose}` with `--pos-support-dept-fg` (solid in light mode, inverted in dark). Hosts can override them, but then they own the contrast. Icons are Lucide (ISC licence) in one SVG sprite (`partials/icons/sprite`). Settings → Branding shows where the brand comes from (host stylesheet, `support_branding` hook, overrides), a preview, and overrides for name, sender name, theme and background colours, both logos, the sidebar logo choice, app icon and favicon. Each image can be uploaded (stored in public file storage, table `modules/support/brand_image`; logos PNG/SVG/WebP/JPEG, app icon a square PNG of at least 512 px, favicon ICO/PNG/SVG, at most 2 MB; SVGs with scripts, event handlers or external links are refused) or given as an https link. Appearance has its own control: **Follow the host app** (the default) uses the hook's `theme_mode`; the other choices override it.

Look and feel (Gyöngy's design handoff v3, Nov 2026; the values and reasons are in the handoff's `implementation-todo.md` and `design-decisions.md`):
- **Brand colour, one source.** Everything brand-coloured is derived from the host's primary token (`--pos-color-button-primary-background`) as fixed percentages, light and dark: the sidebar (5% over its grey), its hover (10%) and selected item (16%, with the count in a solid brand circle), dividers, selected segments and secondary buttons (22%), the board columns and the ticket conversation (a 17% → 5% wash), table headers (14%), row hover and checked rows (6% / 12%), brand-tinted hover shadows. Links and focus use `--pos-color-interactive` / `--pos-color-focused`; text on the brand fill is always white.
- **Accessible brand.** When the host's `theme_color` (or the Branding page override) is too light for white text or brand text on its own tints, the desk shifts it to a darker shade of the same hue (`helpers/brand_shift`, OKLCH, computed once per colour and cached) and writes the brand tokens after the host stylesheet (`partials/brand_tokens`); the Branding page says so, with a light / dark preview. The Branding page colour override recolours the desk. A colour that passes stays with the host's own stylesheet.
- **Brand block.** A 3rem mark with the app name and "Support desk" below: the host's `icon_url` as is, else its `logo_url`, else the module's support icon (`images/pos-support-icon.png`) in a frame of a dark brand shade, recoloured to the brand. Setting `icon_url` to the module's icon shows it framed in its own colours. With no host icon an admin's browser draws the same framed icon as the 512 px app icon (manifest, home screen, favicon, push). The mark turns once on hover.
- **Departments** have a colour from a fixed palette of 10, stored as a number 1–10 (`data-dept-color`); the default catch-all department is always neutral grey. The tag-shaped marker shows in the sidebar, list rows, the department filters, the queue heading when filtered (and the browser title), the ticket title, and quietly on board cards.
- **Statuses** can have their own icon (Settings → Statuses); the seed gives Under review an eye and Spam a ban sign.
- **Avatars** follow the role (`data-person`, `data-role`): agents a pale per-person colour, managers and admins the brand colour with a star or shield badge (avatars of 28px and up), automatic emails a mail icon on the brand, customers grey. Availability is a filled, half or hollow dot.
- **Board cards**: on hover and drag only the background grows, with a brand ring and shadow, and a drag handle appears; an overdue card has a red "!" pinned to its edge that pings at rest and opens to "! Overdue" (red ring) on hover and focus. Reduced motion turns the movement off.
- **Dropdowns with markers** (`pos-support-select.js`, WAI-ARIA select-only combobox) for the priority, department, status and assignee filters and the ticket panel's assignee and department; plain selects without JavaScript. "Reset all filters" is a primary icon button with a tooltip (`[data-tooltip]`, Escape hides it).
- **The sidebar** collapses to icons on desktop (a round button on the divider; kept in the session, `support_rail`) with a floating name · count tooltip per item.
- The example app has the handoff's five test themes, picked with `?host_theme=default|pos|sample-host-1|sample-host-2|sample-host-3`.

## Routes

Desk: `/support-desk` (queue; `view`, `department_id`, `priority`, `status_key`, `assignee_id`, `q`, `sort`, and `layout=list|board` and `group=priority|status`, which are remembered in the session), `/support-desk/board` (the board of a view), `/support-desk/tickets/:id`, `/support-desk/contacts/:id`, `/support-desk/organizations/:id`, `/support-desk/profile`, `/support-desk/settings/*`, `/support-desk/sign-in`, `/support-desk/request-access`, `/support-desk/invites/:id`. PWA: `/support-desk/manifest.json`, `/support-desk/sw.js` (scope `/support-desk`). Webhooks: `/api/support/inbound/:provider/:secret`, `/api/support/email-events/:provider/:secret`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Customer emails do not arrive as tickets.** Check the MX record for the inbound hostname, then Settings → Email → Check inbound. Look for `support` entries in `pos-cli logs <env>`. A sender on the blocklist is refused before anything is stored (Settings → Blocklist shows hits). An email with more than about 11 MB of attachments never reaches the desk: platformOS refuses requests over about 16 MB before any page runs, and the provider gives up after its retries without telling the sender. The acknowledgement tells customers to keep attachments under 10 MB and share larger files through a link.
- **Nothing is sent.** Sending is off until Settings → Email → Enable. On staging, enable API call notifications in the Partner Portal. A 4xx answer from the provider is permanent and shown on the message (with Send again); 408/429 are retried up to five times and 5xx three times.
- **Replies start new tickets.** The reply address carries a token signed with `REPLY_TOKEN_SECRET`; changing that constant breaks threading for older emails. Replies without the token are matched by `In-Reply-To`/`References`, then by subject and sender.
- **SLA timers or alerts stopped.** Settings → Integrations shows the maintenance sweep's last run; "Restart" starts it again. The sweep also restarts by itself when a desk page is opened and it has not run for 15 minutes.
- **Locked out.** Add your email to `modules/support/ADMIN_EMAILS` and sign in again.
- **No push notifications.** The push module's constants must be set (`pos-cli generate run modules/push_notifications/generators/install`); each person enables push on their profile page.

## Development

- The example host app in `app/` (not distributed) is a marketing site at `/` and a community-style admin area at `/admin` (host roles `superadmin` and `editor`, both with `admin_pages.view`), with a demo theme and branding hooks.
- Tests: `pos-cli test run <env>` runs `app/lib/test/support/*_test.liquid` (needs the `tests` module); `npm run test:static` runs the static checks; `pos-cli check run` must report no offenses (CI fails on warnings).
- Seed an environment: `./tests/data/seed/seed.sh <env> [--keep-data]`.
- Tasks and decisions: `backlog/`; the technical specification: `docs/spec/`; progress board: https://github.com/orgs/Platform-OS/projects/28.
